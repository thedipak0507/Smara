# Smara
Smara: An Offline-first AI avatar engine designed to run real-time, ultra-realistic digital humans locally on a single CPU. No GPU or cloud required.

> **Note:** This repository serves as the public technical documentation, architecture overview, and roadmap for the Smara Engine. **The source code is proprietary and closed-source (For NOW).**

## 🚀 What is Smara?
Smara is a AI avatar framework engineered to shatter the hardware barriers of digital human generation. While the industry relies on expensive cloud GPUs and constant internet connectivity, Smara brings real-time, high-fidelity digital humans directly to the edge. 

## ⚡ The Core Innovation (Our Moat)
* **CPU-Only Inference:** No GPU required. Smara is mathematically optimized to run fluidly on standard, low-end CPUs, democratizing access to AI avatars.
* **100% Offline Capability:** Operates entirely locally. Zero data leaves the device, guaranteeing absolute privacy for sensitive use cases.
* **Zero Latency:** By bypassing cloud servers, conversational latency is drastically reduced, enabling true real-time interaction.
* **Online Platform:** It can also be used online in coming web platform for enterprises and other use cases.

## 📊 Competitive Matrix

| Feature | 🧠 Smara Engine | Cloud APIs (HeyGen,Synthesia etc.) | Open Source (SadTalker) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Processing** | **Local CPU** | Cloud Server | Heavy Local GPU |
| **Internet Needed?**| **No (Offline)** | Yes (High Bandwidth) | No |
| **Privacy Risk** | **Zero** | High (Data sent to server) | Low |
| **Operating Cost**| **$0 (Edge compute)** | High ($ per minute) | Free (But high hardware cost) |

## ⚙️ Current Capabilities
As of the current build, the engine supports:
* **Real-time Simulation:** Fluid, low-latency animation and lip-syncing for pre-existing avatar models.
* **Language Support:** Fully optimized for English language processing, Multilingual at coming online platform.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Upcoming Features
We are aggressively expanding the engine's capabilities. 

- ✅ Achieve ultra-realistic synthesis on a single CPU.
- ✅ Establish a 100% offline, privacy-first pipeline.
- ✅ Real-time simulation for existing avatars(In completion process)
- ✅ Audio to Avatar simulation.
- ⬜ **Instant Avatar Generation:** Custom photo-to-avatar generation directly on-device (In process)
- ⬜ **Expressive Avatars:** To deploy emotionally expressive Avatars.
- ⬜ **Multilingual Support:** Adding native Bharatiya(Indian) & global languages to bridge the dialect gap.


## 🤝 Licensing & B2B Partnerships
Smara is moving out of prototype and actively seeking pilot partners for impactful, privacy-first deployments. We welcome collaborations with:
1. **CSR Foundations:** Deploy offline AI Avatars for various use cases for social needs improve social interaction.
2. **Enterprises Focused on Privacy:** Integrate secure, on-device AI mediators, trainers, assistants for sensitive workflows and compliance-sensitive use cases.

- currently i'm only developer, and seeking expert team members.
